    <h1>History of Scotch</h1>
    <p>
        Scotch, a subset of a broader cateogry of spirits known as whisky, is a spirit unique to Scotland and steeped in character and history. Many modern distilleries have been in operation for upwards of 200 years and have developed unique flavor profiles and characteristics based on their regional preference. Despite this history, Scotch can trace its origins much further back than that even, some records as far back as the late 15th century. Over the course of centuries, many contributions were made in the development of Scotch via monastic orders and later through more legitimate distilleries, both legal and illegal. Scotch was originally taxed in 1644 and was later, in the beginning of the 19th century, rules were relaxed to allow for more readily available distillation options. Because of these laws, many distilleries date back to the early 19th century, but few from the late 18th century still exist.

    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    <p>
        Unlike some other distilled spirits, Scotch is a more intense and specific version of its base spirit, whisky. It is important to remember that, while not all whiskies are scotches, all scotches are indeed whiskies. Because Scotch can only be officially created in Scotland, a great variation in flavor has been developed across its distilleries. These flavors range from characteristics like wine and fruit, floral and wood, and even things like brine and peat (smoke). Many of the most common scotches are found in the Speyside region, widely known for its softer, fruitier, and more floral notes. These create a more accessible approach to diving into the world of scotch. Below, we will go a bit more into the various distilling regions in Scotland and how they lend their own unique characteristics to the world of scotch.

    <h3>Your First Dram</h3>
    <p>
        Once you've decided on a flavor profile, it is important to understand the best way to ease into taking your first drinks of Scotch. Because it is, at its core, still a whisky, Scotch is bottled at 40% ABV or higher, depending on the pour. For many people, this is a large jump compared to a beer, cocktail, or mixed drink. When trying to drink Scotch, it is important to realize that it may be necessary to add water in small doses to help break up the flavor. This is referred to as "cutting" and, even amongst seasoned Scotch and whisky enthusiasts, cutting can be used to help bring out additional flavors not found in a normal sampling. Do not feel like you are taking away from the experience by adding a bit of water to those first pours because, once you get used to the sensation that Scotch brings, you will learn to add less and less water to be able to enjoy the drink. Below is a list of good Scotches to start with and, as with all things, drink responsibly and enjoy delving into the world of Scotch whisky.
